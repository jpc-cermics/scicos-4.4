   *                                           Robert J. Renka 
   *                                 Dept. of Computer Science 
   *                                      Univ. of North Texas 
   *                                          renka@cs.unt.edu 
   *                                                  02/13/97 
   * 
   *  This subroutine computes a set of parameters defining a 
   *C2 (twice continuously differentiable) bivariate function 
   *C(X,Y) which interpolates data values F at a set of N 
   *arbitrarily distributed points (X,Y) in the plane (nodes). 
   *The interpolant C may be evaluated at an arbitrary point 
   *by function CS2VAL, and its first partial derivatives are 
   *computed by Subroutine CS2GRD. 
   * 
   *  The interpolation scheme is a modified Cubic Shepard 
   *method: 
   * 
   *C = [W(1)*C(1)+W(2)*C(2)+..+W(N)*C(N)]/[W(1)+W(2)+..+W(N)] 
   * 
   *for bivariate functions W(k) and C(k).  The nodal func- 
   *tions are given by 
   * 
   * C(k)(x,y) = A(1,k)*(x-X(k))**3 + 
   *             A(2,k)*(x-X(k))**2*(y-Y(k)) + 
   *             A(3,k)*(x-X(k))*(y-Y(k))**2 + 
   *             A(4,k)*(y-Y(k))**3 + A(5,k)*(x-X(k))**2 + 
   *             A(6,k)*(x-X(k))*(y-Y(k)) + A(7,k)*(y-Y(k))**2 
   *             + A(8,k)*(x-X(k)) + A(9,k)*(y-Y(k)) + F(k) . 
   * 
   *Thus, C(k) is a cubic function which interpolates the data 
   *value at node k.  Its coefficients A(,k) are obtained by a 
   *weighted least squares fit to the closest NC data points 
   *with weights similar to W(k).  Note that the radius of 
   *influence for the least squares fit is fixed for each k, 
   *but varies with k. 
   * 
   *The weights are taken to be 
   * 
   *  W(k)(x,y) = ( (R(k)-D(k))+ / R(k)*D(k) )**3 , 
   * 
   *where (R(k)-D(k))+ = 0 if R(k) < D(k), and D(k)(x,y) is 
   *the Euclidean distance between (x,y) and (X(k),Y(k)).  The 
   *radius of influence R(k) varies with k and is chosen so 
   *that NW nodes are within the radius.  Note that W(k) is 
   *not defined at node (X(k),Y(k)), but C(x,y) has limit F(k) 
   *as (x,y) approaches (X(k),Y(k)). 
   * 
   *On input: 
   * 
   *      N = Number of nodes and data values.  N .GE. 10. 
   * 
   *      X,Y = Arrays of length N containing the Cartesian 
   *            coordinates of the nodes. 
   * 
   *      F = Array of length N containing the data values 
   *          in one-to-one correspondence with the nodes. 
   * 
   *      NC = Number of data points to be used in the least 
   *           squares fit for coefficients defining the nodal 
   *           functions C(k).  Values found to be optimal for 
   *           test data sets ranged from 11 to 25.  A recom- 
   *           mended value for general data sets is NC = 17. 
   *           For nodes lying on (or close to) a rectangular 
   *           grid, the recommended value is NC = 11.  In any 
   *           case, NC must be in the range 9 to Min(40,N-1). 
   * 
   *      NW = Number of nodes within (and defining) the radii 
   *           of influence R(k) which enter into the weights 
   *           W(k).  For N sufficiently large, a recommended 
   *           value is NW = 30.  In general, NW should be 
   *           about 1.5*NC.  1 .LE. NW .LE. Min(40,N-1). 
   * 
   *      NR = Number of rows and columns in the cell grid de- 
   *           fined in Subroutine STORE2.  A rectangle con- 
   *           taining the nodes is partitioned into cells in 
   *           order to increase search efficiency.  NR = 
   *           Sqrt(N/3) is recommended.  NR .GE. 1.

   * 
   *      RW = Array of length .GE. N. 
   *

   *      LCELL = NR by NR array of nodal indexes associated 
   *              with cells.  Refer to Subroutine STORE2.

   *              indexes.  Refer to Subroutine STORE2.

   *                        dimensions.  Refer to Subroutine 
   *                        STORE2.

   *           into the weights W(k).

   *      A = 9 by N array containing the coefficients for 
   *          cubic nodal function C(k) in column k. 
   * 
   *  Note that the output parameters described above are not 
   *defined unless IER = 0. 
   * 
   *      IER = Error indicator: 
   *            IER = 0 if no errors were encountered. 
   *            IER = 1 if N, NC, NW, or NR is outside its 
   *                    valid range.

   *  This subroutine computes the value, gradient, and 
   *Hessian at P = (PX,PY) of the interpolatory function C 
   *defined in Subroutine CSHEP2.  C is a weighted sum of 
   *cubic nodal functions. 
   * 
   *On input: 
   * 
   *      PX,PY = Cartesian coordinates of the point P at 
   *              which C and its partial derivatives are 
   *              to be evaluated. 
   * 
   *      N = Number of nodes and data values defining C. 
   *          N .GE. 10. 
   * 
   *      X,Y,F = Arrays of length N containing the nodes and

   *              indexes.  Refer to Subroutine STORE2. 
   * 
   *      XMIN,YMIN,DX,DY = Minimum nodal coordinates and cell

   *      A = 9 by N array containing the coefficients for 
   *          cubic nodal function C(k) in column k. 
   * 
   *  Input parameters are not altered by this subroutine. 
   *The parameters other than PX and PY should be input 
   *unaltered from their values on output from CSHEP2.  This 
   *subroutine should not be called if a nonzero error flag 
   *was returned by CSHEP2. 
   * 
   *On output: 
   * 
   *      C = Value of C at (PX,PY) unless IER .EQ. 1, in 
   *          which case no values are returned. 
   * 
   *      CX,CY = First partial derivatives of C at (PX,PY) 
   *              unless IER .EQ. 1. 
   * 
   *      CXX,CXY,CYY = Second partial derivatives of C at 
   *                    (PX,PY) unless IER .EQ. 1. 
   * 
   *      IER = Error indicator: 
   *            IER = 0 if no errors were encountered. 
   *            IER = 1 if N, NR, DX, DY or RMAX is invalid. 
   *            IER = 2 if no errors were encountered but

   * 
   *  Given a set of N nodes and the data structure defined in 
   *Subroutine STORE2, this subroutine uses the cell method to 
   *find the closest unmarked node NP to a specified point P. 
   *NP is then marked by setting LNEXT(NP) to -LNEXT(NP).  (A 
   *node is marked if and only if the corresponding LNEXT ele- 
   *ment is negative.  The absolute values of LNEXT elements, 
   *however, must be preserved.)  Thus, the closest M nodes to 
   *P may be determined by a sequence of M calls to this rou- 
   *tine.  Note that if the nearest neighbor to node K is to 
   *be determined (PX = X(K) and PY = Y(K)), then K should be 
   *marked before the call to this routine. 
   * 
   *  The search is begun in the cell containing (or closest 
   *to) P and proceeds outward in rectangular layers until all 
   *cells which contain points within distance R of P have 
   *been searched, where R is the distance from P to the first 
   *unmarked node encountered (infinite if no unmarked nodes 
   *are present). 
   * 
   *  This code is essentially unaltered from the subroutine 
   *of the same name in QSHEP2D. 
   * 
   *On input: 
   * 
   *      PX,PY = Cartesian coordinates of the point P whose 
   *              nearest unmarked neighbor is to be found. 
   * 
   *      X,Y = Arrays of length N, for N .GE. 2, containing 
   *            the Cartesian coordinates of the nodes. 
   * 
   *      NR = Number of rows and columns in the cell grid. 
   *           Refer to Subroutine STORE2.  NR .GE. 1. 
   * 
   *      LCELL = NR by NR array of nodal indexes associated 
   *              with cells.  Refer to Subroutine STORE2. 
   * 
   *      LNEXT = Array of length N containing next-node 
   *              indexes (or their negatives).  Refer to 
   *              Subroutine STORE2. 
   * 
   *      XMIN,YMIN,DX,DY = Minimum nodal coordinates and cell 
   *                        dimensions.  DX and DY must be 
   *                        positive.  Refer to Subroutine 
   *                        STORE2. 
   * 
   *  Input parameters other than LNEXT are not altered by 
   *this routine.  With the exception of (PX,PY) and the signs 
   *of LNEXT elements, these parameters should be unaltered 
   *from their values on output from Subroutine STORE2. 
   * 
   *On output: 
   * 
   *      NP = Index (for X and Y) of the nearest unmarked 
   *           node to P, or 0 if all nodes are marked or NR 
   *           .LT. 1 or DX .LE. 0 or DY .LE. 0.  LNEXT(NP) 
   *           .LT. 0 IF NP .NE. 0. 
   * 
   *      DSQ = Squared Euclidean distance between P and node

   *  Given a set of N arbitrarily distributed nodes in the 
   *plane, this subroutine creates a data structure for a 
   *cell-based method of solving closest-point problems.  The 
   *smallest rectangle containing the nodes is partitioned 
   *into an NR by NR uniform grid of cells, and nodes are as- 
   *sociated with cells.  In particular, the data structure 
   *stores the indexes of the nodes contained in each cell. 
   *For a uniform random distribution of nodes, the nearest 
   *node to an arbitrary point can be determined in constant 
   *expected time. 
   * 
   *  This code is essentially unaltered from the subroutine 
   *of the same name in QSHEP2D.

   *On input:

   *            coordinates of the nodes.

   *      NR = Number of rows and columns in the grid.  The 
   *           cell density (average number of nodes per cell) 
   *           is D = N/(NR**2).  A recommended value, based 
   *           on empirical evidence, is D = 3 -- NR =

   *              If, for example, cell (I,J) contains nodes
